This topic describes how to deploy Ops Manager for Pivotal Container Service (PKS) on Google Cloud Platform (GCP).

After you complete this procedure, follow the instructions in the [Configuring Ops Manager on GCP](./gcp-om-config.html) topic.

## <a id='select-tgz'></a>Step 1: Locate the Pivotal Ops Manager Installation File

1. Log in to the [Pivotal Network](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pivotal-cf), and click on **Pivotal Cloud Foundry Operations Manager**.

1. From the **Releases** drop-down, select the release to install.

1. Select one of the following download files:
    * **Pivotal Cloud Foundry Ops Manager for GCP**
    * **Pivotal Cloud Foundry Ops Manager YAML for GCP**

    When you click on the download link, your browser downloads or opens a YAML or PDF file. This file provides the GCP location of the Ops Manager `.tar.gz` installation file based on the geographic location of your installation.

1. Copy the filepath string of the Ops Manager image based on your deployment location.

## <a id="create-image"></a>Step 2: Create a Private VM Image

1. Log in to the [GCP Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).

1. In the left navigation panel, click **Compute Engine**, and select **Images**.

1. Click **Create Image**.

1. Complete the following fields:
  * **Name**: Enter a name. For example, `opsman-pcf-gcp-2-0`.
  * **Encryption**: Leave **Google-managed key** selected.
  * **Source**: Choose **Cloud Storage file**.
  * **Cloud Storage file**: Paste in the Google Cloud Storage filepath you copied from the PDF file in the [previous step](#select-tgz). 
1. Click **Create**. The file may take a few minutes to import. 

## <a id="start-vm"></a>Step 3: Create the Ops Manager VM Instance

1. Select the checkbox for the image that you created above.

1. Click **Create Instance**.

1. In the **Create an instance form**, complete the following fields:
  * **Name**: Enter a name that matches the naming conventions of your deployment.
  * **Zone**: Choose a zone from the region in which you created your network.
  * **Machine type**: Choose `n1-standard-2`. 
    * Click **Customize** to manually configure the vCPU and memory. An Ops Manager VM instance requires the following minimum specifications:
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Machine Spec</th>
            <th>Minimum Value</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>CPU</td>
            <td>2&nbsp;vCPUs</td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Memory</td>
            <td>8&nbsp;GB</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
  * **Boot disk**: Click **Change**, then perform the following steps:
     * Click **Custom images** if it is not already selected. 
     * Select the **Boot disk type**. If you have an Ops Manager environment with high performance needs, select **SSD**. As an example, environments used to [develop PCF tiles](http://docs.pivotal.io/tiledev/) may benefit from a higher performing Ops Manager VM boot disk. For most environments, however, you can select **Standard**.
     * Set the **Size (GB)** of the boot disk to the minimum or higher.
        <table>
          <tr>
            <th>Machine Spec</th>
            <th>Minimum Value</th>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td>Boot disk</td>
            <td>100&nbsp;GB</td>
          </tr>
        </table>
     * Select the Ops Manager image you created in the previous step if it is not already selected.
     * Click **Select** to save.
  * Under **Identity and API access**, for the **Service account**, select the BOSH/Ops Manager service account that you created in [Step 2: Create Service Accounts](./gcp-prepare-env.html#create-bosh-ops-man) of _Preparing to Deploy PKS on GCP_.
  * **Allow HTTP traffic**: Leave this checkbox unselected.  
  * **Allow HTTPS traffic**: Leave this checkbox unselected. 
  * **Networking**: Select the **Networking** tab, and perform the following steps:
     * Under **Network interfaces**, perform the following steps:
        * Remove the `default` network interface if this interface still exists.
        * Select the network (for example, `MY-PKS-virt-network`) that you created when preparing your environment in the [Create a GCP Network with Subnets](./gcp-prepare-env.html#create-network) section of the _Preparing to Deploy PKS on GCP_ topic. 
        * Under **Subnetwork**, select the `MY-PKS-subnet-infrastructure-MY-GCP-REGION` subnet that you created when preparing your environment in the [Create a GCP Network with Subnets](./gcp-prepare-env.html#create-network) section of the _Preparing to Deploy PKS on GCP_ topic. 
        * For **Primary internal IP**, select **Ephemeral (Custom)**. Enter an IP address (for example, `192.168.101.5`) in the **Custom ephemeral IP address** field. Specify the next available internal IP address located within the reserved IP address range that you will configure in Ops Manager (see [Step 5: Create Networks Page](./gcp-om-config.html#network)). Do not use the **Gateway IP**, for example `192.168.101.1`. Confirm that the Primary Internal IP you select for OpsManager is from the infrastructure subnet you created in the previous step.
        * For **External IP**, select **Create IP address**. In the next form, enter a name for the static IP. For example, `om-public-ip`. Click **Reserve**. In the **External IP** drop-down, select the static IP address you just reserved.
     * For **Network tags**, enter `MY-PKS-opsman`, `allow-https`, and `allow-ssh`. These tags apply the firewall rules you created in [Create Firewall Rules for the Network](gcp-prepare-env.html#firewall-rules) to the Ops Manager VM, allowing you to SSH into the Ops Manager VM.
    
1. Click **Create** to deploy the new Ops Manager VM. This may take a few moments.

1. Navigate to your DNS provider and create an entry that points the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) `opsman.MY-DOMAIN` to the `om-public-ip` external static IP address of Ops Manager that you created in a previous step.
For example:
<pre>opsman.pks.example.com     A     300     192.168.101.5</pre>
   <p class="note"><strong>Note</strong>: In order to set up Ops Manager authentication correctly, Pivotal recommends using an FQDN to access Ops Manager. Using an ephemeral IP address to access Ops Manager can cause authentication errors upon subsequent access.</p>
